<strong>LoRa</strong> is a powerful and flexible radio communication system based on different hardware solutions: Arduino shield, Maduino board (arduino+LoRa) or LoRa radiocommand. LoRa module for long range radio system is based on Radio Module 433MHz : RFM98 or equivalent like SX1278. 
You can find and download library in sub-directory using <strong>&lt;<em>release</em>&gt;</strong> tag up there.

Recent version is 3.0.

With this Arduino library you can create several nodes in a network and communicate with kilometric range.
Network managed by this library is not the LoRaWAN network but a simpler proprietary network.

(see NodeLora-It.pdf or NodeLora-En for more details)
(see LoRaHardware.pdf for more details about platforms)

NB Library is entirely included in LORA directory; sources, examples, help files and pdf doc. To use library just uncompress zip file and put LORA directory into ...../Arduino/libraries directory (as others Arduino libraries)
