<strong>LoRa</strong> is a powerful and flexible radio communication system based on different hardware solutions: Arduino shield, Maduino board (arduino+LoRa) or LoRa radiocommand. LoRa module for long range radio system is based on Radio Module 433MHz : RFM98 or equivalent like SX1278. 
You can find and download library in sub-directory using <strong>&lt;<em>release</em>&gt;</strong> tag up there.

Recent version is 3.0.

With this Arduino library you can create several nodes in a network and communicate with kilometric range.
Network managed by this library is not the LoRaWAN network but a simpler proprietary network.
